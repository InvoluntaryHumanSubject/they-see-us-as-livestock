Much happened, as always, just didn't really want to write, but still have to write.

Not going to write the relatively important things except that I asked for information about withdrawing asylum application. The responses so far were just that I have to write application for it... Not informational at all. More than one year here, I still don't have proper information on many things, on most things perhaps. And there will be a decision about my asylum application soon.

Some seemingly trivial things which I hope they are actually really unimportant are:

Earlier the one in my room was replaced by another again, the most recent one left about 2 weeks ago. Some of their strange behaviours  were.

The previous one littered the room and made the room smelly. I might have smell myself especially because I spend most time indoor, but his was another level, I can only guess that was created intentionally. He also dropped coins of cents on the floor of the room. The meaning was clear. I still take the small allowance of 15.7 euros each month, which was said to be an allowance for asylum seekers.

The most recent one kept opening the blind and switching on the ceiling light. Sometimes even during the brightest hours. Sometimes just switching on and leaving the room. And whenever I switched it off, he would come back promptly to switch it on again, sometimes just to switch it on again, as in leaving the room again right after. Probably realized it was too obvious and changed a bit later. Actually the previous one also did the same once or twice.

2 days ago looked for the source of some bad smell in my room. Found some rubbish that didn't belong to me in the rubbish bin in my room, including some dirty tissues with probably semen and tobacco boxes.

Though there might be different or extra reasons. This kind of behaviour is not new. Similar things happened in the past. One example was turning on a tap and leaving when I was at another basin.

Got a reply that I would be deported back to my country of origin if I withdraw my asylum application. I replied it is not safe, asked if I can choose my destination and asked for official documents about the matter.

I will try to leave legally. I will write at least twice more. One before departing and one when I arrive somewhere safe. If I don't, it means something terrible happened. 

I emphasise legally because they made a lot indirect suggestions, more than a hundred times, about going to another country while withholding my passport.

In fact, many things I wrote in the entries were out of fear that I could be framed for something. I used to write precaution letters to the authority here, I thought it was the influence of the Chinese Communist Party. It probably was, and still is, but the authority here is facilitating it.

A large part of what I am experiencing here seem to mean to let them satisfy themselves by harassing, humilating and insulting me, with the help of power abuse.

They are also constantly collecting my image, voice and forcing me to write by requiring an "application" for almost everything, sometimes even a simple question. And when I wrote, there was no reply, too. And they donâ€™t admit the surveillance and recording.

Writing these might gain me some extra harm. But not writing it won't go anywhere either. If being nice helps nothing of what I wrote should have happened. If I remain silent they don't feel a problem of what they are doing; if I don't they think that I should be thankful that they haven't done worse.

That mentality is probably a big part of Lucifer Effect.

Find "[Surveillance_and_Cultral_Revolution_n.txt](https://github.com/locharp/doomsay/blob/main/en/Surveillance_and_Cultral_Revolution_n.txt)" in [this GitHub. From what I see it correctly describes the mentality of many here.

That, "[AuthoritarianMethods.txt](https://github.com/locharp/doomsay/blob/main/en/AuthoritarianMethods.txt)" and "[PettyManagement.txt](https://github.com/locharp/doomsay/blob/main/en/PettyManagement.txt)" should encapsulate the essence of much of what is happening, from my point of view. The exact reason why they are so awful is a question only they can answer.
