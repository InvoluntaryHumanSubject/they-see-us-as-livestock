Much happened, as always, just didn't really want to write, but still have to write.

Not going to write the relatively important things except that I asked for information about withdrawing asylum application. The responses so far were just that I have to write application for it... Not informational at all.

Some seemingly trivial things which I hope they are actually really unimportant are:

Earlier the one in my room was replaced by another again, the most recent one left about 2 weeks ago. Some of their strange behaviours were.

The previous one litter the room and made the room smelly. I might have smell myself especially because I spend most time indoor, but his was another level, I can only guess that was created intentionally.

The most recent one kept opening the blind and switching on the ceiling light. Sometimes even during the brightest hours. Sometimes just switching on and leaving the room. And whenever I switched it off, he would come back promptly to switch it on again, sometimes just to switch it on again, as in leaving the room again right after. Probably realized it was too obvious and changed a bit later. Actually the previous one also did the same once or twice.

2 days ago looked for the source of some bad smell in my room. Found some rubbish that didn't belong to me in the rubbish bin in my room, including some dirty tissues with probably semen and tobacco boxes.

Though there might be different or extra reasons. This kind of behaviour is not new. Similar things happened in the past. One example was turning on a tap and leaving when I was at another basin.
