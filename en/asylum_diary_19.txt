About a week ago when I talked to my then roommates about opening the window of the room, During the conversation, I said something like "It is not just you doing something for me, I am also doing something for you." It was only referring to him not smoking in the room and I didn't open the window most of the time.

My then roommates were two males claimed to be Iraqis and spoke Arabric. Our converaation was in English.
