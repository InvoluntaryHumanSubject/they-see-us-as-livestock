Last Friday, being told about a a secret court hearing is going to be held online, with an unknown person who has never contacted me representing me.

Left with little time to respond and questions unanswered. Informations about the case is accessible by the unknown person but not me.

The Centre (State Border Guard Service) said that they are only responsible for informing me about the dates (including during other matters), the Migration Department made the arrangement and the court decided the date.

They Migration Department in turn told me to ask the camp (the Foreigners Registration Centre), and said that they don't know what I am talking about.
