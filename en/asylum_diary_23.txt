I was asked to sign a warning for feeding cats. I asked to write on the paper what I didn't think were correct before aigning but was refused. I was forced to choose from signing without writing anything or be written as not signing. I insisted I need to make it clear before signing till the end. They wrote on the paper and told.me to go.

I wrote an application and asked for a written reply for a safe way to handle such situations.

I asked a social worker what she knew about me, she said she wasn't told anything about me.

The social workers were there for hours, no one talked to me other than a hi or good morning, as usual. Until when I was going out to the kitchen at lunch time, I was told to put all my clothes into the locker or I won't be allowed to leave the centre. The reason was that someone from the ministry will visit the next day. I asked if there were anything else, the answer was no.

Was given a cash allowance of 15.7 Euros for January.

I sat in the room for TV and table games on our floor (the second floor) near the entrance (the stairs) to use my phone except for the time for meals as usual. No one came.
