As someone enjoys not getting attention, I am writing daily to record some seemingly meaningless trivial things. My guts tell me that it is important to have things, trivial or not, recorded as they are. Though I still hesitate to put it too blunt.

I was told to see the doctor for checks today. Checked blood pressure and auscultated, blood pressure was low.

There have been quite some fears. Met lawyers from Redcross and asked some of the questions today. They suggest that I should ask for information and fight for my right. They said those do not ask (/apply) are often not given even what they should get. They also said that allowance depends on the Center and part of it is for food and only those have problem with the food of the Center get it.

I used to argue about the definition of real and fake of the virtual (digital and fictional) worlds. Now, I feel discombobulated by the real and fake in our real living world.

Everything in this world is supposed to be real, but I cannot help wondering how much of it is real. Are what I hear real? Are what I see real? I am amazed by the difficulty of spotting real things. More so how casual everything seems. Casual while not real.

When we say that it is important to distinguish the virtual worlds from the real. Do we hold the same standard for fakeries and truths? It has me flabbergasted that some people fiercely reject virtual worlds but comfortably live with fakeries.

So which one is more important? Rejecting virtual worlds or rejecting fakeries in the real world? The virtual or the real?
