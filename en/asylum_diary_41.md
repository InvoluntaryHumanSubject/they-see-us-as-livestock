I am still being toyed with. The chance I can leave for a safe place is dim. More on this later.

With the power to abuse and the surveillance to watch me even when I am in bed, it doesn't only dehumanise me, but also dehumanise them. Any day I don't look weak and depressed, tbey see it as a sign that they can further torture me. A single relaxed posture in my bed makes them feel they haven't done anything serious.

They do not respect human rights, nor do they respect live. Teens and even younger children are also tools of harassment for them. The disappeared cat in Kybartai most likely got killed because they repeatedly trapped it outside the windows, and ultimately caused it to fall off from the building. They have lost their humanity.


Got a headache yesterday and it still feel horrible. The noise that changed/remained aoout two 2 months felt nastier perhaps due to tbe headache. Tried to sleep in the park instead, but it was horrible in another way.*
I can think of another unnatural reason for the headache, but it could because of the noise too.
