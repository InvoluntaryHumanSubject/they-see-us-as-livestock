Was offered Iki cards for food that  valid until tomorrow, total 30-40 euros. Didn't take.

A day a few weeks ago, before moving to the hospital building, was asked if I want a shirt. Didn't take. Accepted a bottle of hand gel later. Was asked if I want some clothes during the conversation with the social worker and interpretor. Didn't take. Accepted a yellow basin later. And a broom for the room, days later was asked to sign for the broom and 2 other cleaning tools that are in the room. There were other things on the paper.
