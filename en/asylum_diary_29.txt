I probably have mentioned before. They might try to justify whafvthey are doing. One of the things they might do is to make up stories about how everything is fine with selective recordings.

10 months here, I have the chance to attend about 5 Lithuanian language lessons, only one of them was more like a lesson, and even that single one had some things strange about it. What they teach the most with the environment they create is how to hate, how to hate being nice, how to hate being even decent.

It is no wonder that those within the walls are so reluctant to take risks and help others. Every single time you allow yourself to be what you would call a human is to get exploited.

Those who still have compassion having exposed to such environments for years are really remarkable. And those being a part of the problem and claim patriotism are disgusting af.
