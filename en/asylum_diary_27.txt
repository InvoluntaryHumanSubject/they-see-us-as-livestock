Last week, the day after moving to the building the doctors work at, I asked to be treated fairly in the future. And I apologized for being difficult simply because I asked for the identities of the social worker and interpretor I talked to, where I got only a name for one and a "code number" for the other.

It was ridiculous and pathetic of me to apologize for that when I have been the one whose privacy including but not limited to my current digital and physical activities is shared against my will to many people, when I am the one being monitored, discriminated, harassed, intimidate, insulted for months.

It might have strengthen their sick belief that what they are doing is alright and working.

Pathetic world, pathetic me.
