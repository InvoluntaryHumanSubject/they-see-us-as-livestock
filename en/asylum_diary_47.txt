This morning the door was knocked, opened and closed without anyone showing face again.
Though it is old, perhaps I should add some description which I didn't.

The way this behaviour or whatever you call it was done:
The door was opened slightly, no one showing face.
Sometimes I'd go out to check and ask if they were looking for me. The answers were "no".
It was being done not long after I'd arrived here last year.
The people I found last year were mostly others who I no longer think are refugees and some who claimed to be social workers.
More recently I found that it was also done by interpreter who wear EUAA uniform, officer in uniform and others who looked like staff.

Harassment are still on going when I struggle to get meaningful responses from the officials of both the Migration Department and the State Border Guard Service.
Phone camera pointing are also continuing. I started to try to record this kind of behaviours. It is not easy, but I have to try.
