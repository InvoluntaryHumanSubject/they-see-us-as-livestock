Fell ill and vomited again today. There is more about this, but maybe another time.


Was hoping they let the 2 cats here in the PabradÄ— Centre stay well since weeks ago. Haven't seen one of them since then, and the other only rarely.
Today an officer ask me if I know "the black cat" is alive, thought that she meant the female cat, although the cat is not exactly black and answered no.
Most if not all of the times, there was something bad when she came to say something...
