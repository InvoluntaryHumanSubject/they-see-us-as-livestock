I might have mentioned that the privacy violation might have started since before I left HK, as I questioned why some information was required and refused to provide when the employers failed to provide a valid reason when I applied for jobs in HK. I forgot it actually goes further back. Before that there were instances where organizations, goverment or not, requested or demanded excessive irrevelent information and eventually I started to question and refused to privide irrevelent information even to government departments. And there were indications that my information was used without my consent since then. A less serious but very absurd example is that a social worker tried to convince me to opt in to let a company use my information for other purposes, I refused saying that I didn't want to receive strange calls. And then I received strange call moments after I parted with the social worker.

As I was informed that there are Lithuanian Language lessons regularly now, I am participating. It was an one hour lesson once a week, and recently it became two one hour lessons per week. Although something strange worries me, I join the lessons and try learn.

Yesterday, I couldn't help asked if the lesson was the teacher writes a few words on the board and then gives me a worksheet (or more) and that's it, because that was what that teacher did every time. She answered yes at first, lfsaewo. Later I asked why we were pretending having lessons. She said because someone wants to learn the language and comes everyday. I asked "everyday?" She said not everyday. She said she was trying, I said she was doing the opposite. She tried to teach as less as possible while pretending giving a lesson. I asked if they were directly or indirectly the lessons. She said probably not. I asked who she is actually. She said she is a social worker helper. I asked for her staff ID. She showed some kibd of card but refused to let me take a photo or have the information on it. I asked for the staff number. She asked why I need it, and said that's her personal information. I said I need to identify her. I said I was not asking for her citizen ID and that's the purpose of the staff ID. She refused.
