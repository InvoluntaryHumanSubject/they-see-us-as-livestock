Was asked to take a wardrobe from ground floor to the room with a roommate this morning. Was asked to write my name and the ID(case number?) used at the center on a write paper after. Asked what it was for, the answer was "(something) later". Since there is a communication hardship because of language, didn't want to make it difficult for the social worker (I guess). Unfortunately it is 22:30 now, and I still don't know what it is for.

Side note: perhaps because of religion, my African roommates have islamic names.

Recently, when exercising (mostly punching sandbag), I see an increased number of people come to the gym in the park.

5 months now.
