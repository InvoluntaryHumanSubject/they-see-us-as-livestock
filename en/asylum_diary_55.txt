There were some serious things that I don't want to write about at the moment.

Other than that, there has always been people that happened to talk outside my room, or anywhere around me, in addition to the normal ones you would encounter. In a way that seemed to be meant for you but at the same time didn't care if you really hear them or not. I know it sound strange, but strange is normal here, around me at least.

Recently, there were a few louder ones I don't know if they fall into the same category. One happeneded tonight and it turned out to be someone talking to some officers. It happeneded that when I went into the toilet, they also moved to the toilet. But no one talked to me. Let's hope it had nothing to do with me.

There were some changes about the phone camera aimming. Some good and some bad. On the surface at least.
