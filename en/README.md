### location:
Pabradė foreigner’s registration centre

### Author situation:
Essentially imprisoned with passport taken while applied for asylum and the State Border Guard Service and the Migration Department refuse to return with excuses.

- prevented from leaving by refusing to return passport
- under constant invasive surveillance including in bed
- also under digital surveillance includes what I write here
- surveillance result and other privacy violated for entertainment, harassment and unknown purposes.

These are constant, There are others that happened before or happen from time to time.

- image and voice collected in a sick manner, in an controlled environment with me constantly harassed.
- forced to write for all kinds of things from a simple question to artificial difficulties. Won't be replied. The latest one was rejected because they do not like it, told to rewrite without mentioning background and details, so basically only what they want.
- forbidden to record when they have been doing it without my consent all along.

These are extremely sick. The more I think about it, the sicker I find they are.

And all these started right from the beginning, but they claim otherwise.
