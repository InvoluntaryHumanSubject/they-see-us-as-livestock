The person who moved into the room weeks ago is replaced by another. The change was made yesterday, when I went the train station. There seemed to be some dramas played, likely made video and audio records too.

Dramas and recordings are part of the routine but I am writing this down just in case. And when I say filming and recording I mean those in additional to the constant surveillance that happens even where I sleep. It is obvious that I extremly hate that, and some people did it smirking, with unknown mentality.

Might also be recorded yesterday when I digged through the rubbish to find a small thing that I carelessly put into the rubbish bin in the room. There had been situations, for unknown mentality, created to make me deal with trash in the past. This time there might be another reason though.

There wasn't much in the bin since I have barely anything to throw away. It was around 10% full before I moved in months ago and remained almost exactly the same in the past months. Put into it mostly just dust from the floor and bits of skin. The person who left yesterday didn't use it too much either, just added around 15% to its volume, with the newly added rubbish being mostly tissues and packages of food and other things.

Originally cancelled this edit, but probably better post it after all.

To avoid some [noises (or rather, vibration)](https://github.com/locharp/asylum_diary/tree/main/aac) which have strangely small focused areas of effect and occur at specific points of place such as the head area of my bed, often become slighgly louder at night (having the quietness of night considered). Though the areas of effect could move sometimes, I moved the mattress and slept on the floor last night. Got lumbago when woke up. Well, it is not surprising, even while sleeping on the bed I had to frequently change position and sleep with strange position to avoid (strongest points of) the strange noise.

The floor was relatively dustier and the room messier than before. The person who replaced the last guy appearantly doesn't stay here too much and doesn't sleep in the room at night very often. But the originally empty but tidy room was occupied by things including rubbish. I tidied it up in the morning.

The person appeared in the park where I exercise brifely regularly, held his phone at his ear, with the kind of, to use neutral words, smile I am no stranger to since last year.

There are other things, but as a conclusion, I find what I wrote in the past about humanity and societies proved to be very true, and that is a pity for humanity.

Please checkout the README of the acc directory of the vibration noise above, I have written some important information there. The most important one is the [Harrassmenttechniques.pdf](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Torture/Call/Individuals/Harrassmenttechniques.pdf), so I also link to it here. It is actually not only about harrassment, but attack on multi-aspects of the victims.
