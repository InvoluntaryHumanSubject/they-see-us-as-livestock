The clothes I put outside of the building for the cats to rest on were thrown into a large trash container and I had to get them back from the trash. There is no way they did not know that with the surveillance, it's not a secret place, and I have been doing that for a while. Mostly likely some assholes set it up for some pathetic reason. This is not the first time they create stituations where I have to dealt with the trash. And the cleaning workers I said I helped before? Happily joined their harassment. I regret why I cared enough to help. These people are making me hate doing anything good.
