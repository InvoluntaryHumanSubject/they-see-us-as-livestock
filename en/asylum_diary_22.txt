The clothes I put outside of the building for the cats to rest on were thrown into a large trash container and I had to get them back from the trash. There is no way they did not know that with the surveillance. Mostly likely some assholes set it up for some pathetic reason. In my previous entries I have mentioned that they wanted to make me to similar things. And the cleaning workers I helped? happily joined their harassment. I regret why I cared enough to help. These people are making me hate doing anything good.
