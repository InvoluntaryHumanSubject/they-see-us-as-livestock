Arrived at the Migration Department. There is blood at the entrance.

Although being told that I can get my passport, what happened was again the same: five days only, I am responsible for the court case that started without me, a slightly relevant article allows them refuse to let me leave... for how long already? Recorded me without telling me, mixed up things, no clarification, no time. Probably have more to count, but doesn't make much of a difference I guess.

Tried to find help from strangers. Got brought to sit in the cage of a police car.

There is not much left I can do.


I am really slow. I guess mixing things up and disregarding contexts is a hobby?
