The male cat get wounds on him repeatedly in the past month, read more [here](https://github.com/locharp/asylum_diary/tree/main/jpg/20230529).

About a week ago someone moved into the room.

Have been going to the library for computer regularly. Since about a month ago someone else also comes regularly. He seems frequently murmuring something.

There have been quite some people visiting the library including the computer roon lately. Sometimes in group.

Wouldn't think any of these are concerns if nothing is wrong. But if you have been reading, you might already see it is more like nothing is right. Chances is that you couldn't, since I haven't written about every thing.

P.S.
I forgot to mention there were some small groups who came to the computer room of the library bluntly and proudly showed that they are among the human right violators since long ago. The increased visitors I mentioned above are people other than those.
