As if it was not enough, I am restricted from going out to the meeting before the secret court hearing later this morning with a new lawyer who contacted me last week.


evening
I was restricted from going out from the Pabradė foreigner’s registration centre to meet with a new lawyer who contacted me last week by physical force. And then physically forced to attend the secret court hearing on Zoom – a court case whose information I could not access directly. In the process my phone was taken from me with physical force and put in a locker which was out of my sight because I was then locked in a room to “attend” the secret court hearing on Zoom.

The State Border Guard Service and the Migration Department still refuse to return my passport.

I am still monitored like a naked animal constantly. My privacy is then violated for entertainment and harassment.
