I suddenly feel a strong need to keep a daily. I am not a productive writer, nor English my native language. Please bear with me for the quality.

It has been four months since I applied for asylum in Lithuania. And I had my first Lithuanian lesson today. The lesson was given by someone said to be an immigrant that is waiting for work permit. It became Arabic lesson during the latter half. I barely understood anything about the Arabic. But one of the interesting thing is that it was said that there are many words for the same things in Arabic. For example, it was said that there are "300" different words for "lion".

Only the last Lithuanian part remained when I return after lunch.
