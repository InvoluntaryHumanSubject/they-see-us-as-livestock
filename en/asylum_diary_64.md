I have lost the ability to talk.

FFS, I hope this is enough to indicate I have little to do with whatever that are happening and whatever that are going to happen, just like before.
It is much like the early days in Lithuania.

There are more important things I am not writing about.
And think about what have happened, don't think that these trivial things are really trivial.

Wrote the part below the line somewhere else yesterday. This morning the roommate went out and some people came to check power sockets. Asked if they would also check the air conditioner because the room was suffocating. After checking they told me to tell the reception and I noded in response.
Days ago the power in the room was shut down twice. I was told to tell the reception.

There are dramas. And hell, yeah, surveillance and stuff.

Yesterday roommate talked with people about electricity and lightings.
Kettle changed, bed changed.

Just to indicate I am mostly passive, much like the early days in Lithuania.

Seems to me it is going to repeat all over again.

Though I started recording the strange things a few months after the application, if I remember correctly it took Lithuania about 1 year before I really started calling out the problems. There was a very gruesome taunt about it, which I hoped it was from someone hiding in between, but I really don't have faith to think that way anymore.

Just like about 2 years ago. I am trying to avoid troubles. Also just like the past 2 years, it seems that there are a lot going on, dramas, suggestions of contacting lawyer (yes, already, again), requests/complaints (not by me).

Have hoped the things I recorded would prove I had little to do with them but suffer. If I have not mistaken, those who should see have happily ignored it.

I often forget that the sick mentality with which people consider other humans theirs to manipulate or literally owned by them actually caused me suffering long before I left my homeland. And it is devastating to see that there are people who have no problem with it.
