I have lost the ability to talk.

FFS, I hope this is enough to indicate I have little to do with whatever that are happening and whatever that are going to happen, just like before.
It is much like the early days in Lithuania.

There are more important things I am not writing about. (Edit: but this: suffering a very suddent severe respiration problem again. Started shortly before writing this entry. And then the sickness that came with vomiting. I don't know how many times my health has been damaged in the recent years. Visited by someone who claimed to be the SBHL Safeguard Team. Asked if I have health and other problems. Said they would arrange for doctor. When I went to their room to ask for method to verify identies, security came to tell me to ask the reception instead. (resumed) The next day the hotal staff came and ask me to tell them about the problem, said that they would arrange for a GP. I asked where and mentioned that it seemed that I was not registered. They said they would book the GP, I replied that maybe when I am registered. When they left they turned back to ask me to tell them my name. irsbtpmf) And think about what have happened, don't think that these trivial things are really trivial.

Wrote the part below the line somewhere else yesterday. This morning the roommate went out and some people came to check power sockets. Asked if they would also check the air conditioner because the room was suffocating. Happened the control panel became unpowered at that time. I told them it was suffocating even when it was on. They told me to tell the reception and I noded in response.
Days ago the power in the room was shut down twice. I was told to tell the reception.

There are dramas. And hell, yeah, the surveillance and stuff, too.

Yesterday roommate talked with people about electricity and lightings.
Kettle changed, bed changed.

Just to indicate I am mostly passive, much like the early days in Lithuania.

Seems to me it is going to repeat all over again.

Though I started recording the strange things a few months after the application, if I remember correctly it took Lithuania about 1 year before I really started calling out the problems. There was a very gruesome taunt about it, which I hoped it was from someone hiding in between, but I really don't have faith to think that way anymore.

Just like about 2 years ago. I am trying to avoid troubles. Also just like the past 2 years, it seems that there are a lot going on, dramas, suggestions of contacting lawyer (yes, already, again), requests/complaints (not by me).

Have hoped the things I recorded would prove I had little to do with them but suffer. If I have not mistaken, those who should see have happily ignored it.

I often forget that the sick mentality with which people consider other humans theirs to manipulate or literally owned by them actually caused me suffering long before I left my homeland. And it is devastating to see that there are people who have no problem with it.
