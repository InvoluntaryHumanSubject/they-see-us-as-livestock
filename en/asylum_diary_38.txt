The person who moved into the room weeks ago is replaced by another. The change was made yesterday, when I went the train station. There seemed to be some dramas played, likely made video and audio records too.

Dramas and recordings are part of the routine but I am writing this down just in case. And when I say filming and recording I mean those in additional to the constant surveillance that happens even where I sleep. It is obvious that I extremly hate that, and some people did it smirking, with unknown mentality.

Might also be recorded yesterday when I digged through the rubbish to find a small thing that I carelessly put into the rubbish bin in the room. There had been situations, for unknown mentality, created to make me deal with trash in the past. This time there might be another reason though.

There wasn't much in the bin since I have barely anything to throw away. It was around 10% full before I moved in months ago and remained almost exactly the same in the past months. Put into it mostly just dust from the floor and bits of skin. The person who left yesterday didn't use it too much either, just added around 15% to its volume, with the newly added rubbish being mostly tissues and packages of food and other things.
