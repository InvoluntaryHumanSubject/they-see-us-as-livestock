Almost 2 weeks after the first "online court hearing on Zoom" which I had few choices but attended.* Was told to attempt to contact the lawyer* "appointed to my caae by the Migration Department" for my casefile via the email address for general query of the law firm my the judge.

Afterwards, most of the call didn't connect and moat emails were not replied.* I asked repeatedly for direct access to the case including going to the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court in person. The people at the reception sad that they didn't speak English. Used mobile phone for translation, still got told to bring a (human) translator.* Was also told to call or write to the "secretary". Showed them I had already called the number and written to that email address and wasn't replied. They insisted I have to contact that person. Emailed again and wasn't replied yet.

Went to the law firm Glimstedt. Meet the person who are supposed to be "my lawyer". Asked if there is any legal ground for the unreasonable situation. He didn't seem interested in challenging the unreasonables. Showed me a page of "my case info on the court system". Asked to see other pages. Got denied. I left and returned to asked again. Was told that he was in meeting. I asked to wait for him. Was told that he had leave. Tried to go inside to see for myself. Was forcefully stopped. I said their government is committing a crime against me. I was scorned for speaking English, not Lithuanian again. I asked why that matter was bring up in such situation and told them I tried to learn Lithuanian soon after arrived here last year but had been treated badly. They didn't care.

Two days ago received the "allowance for asylum seeker" of 15.7 euros.

Yesterday, the door of the room was again opened and closed in the same way that has happened for more than one year. Went out to check but the person was already gone. Moments later the person who gave me 15.7 euros came to knock the door and asked if "Mostafa" was here.
