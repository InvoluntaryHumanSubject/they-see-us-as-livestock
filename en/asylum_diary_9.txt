Having the same harassments as it has been, some of which using the knowledge of my online/offline activities, as it has been. Nothing special.

Feel bad after writing the petty post. Feel bad writing daily too. Reminds me of some interpreter wanted to intimidate me by implying I was complaining. And I said I was just stating what happened as it was. Was really devastated back then when I found myself still under the same shadow.
