As always, if I am to record every bad thing, there are a lot that have happen. So many that there is no way I can remember all of them. Yesterday I was told to go to the office (not really office, but the entrance of the centre) and was given two copies of translation of the document of the decision to my asylum application, which they gave me a deadline of 16 Oct to sign. The translator who said I cannot record or there would be no translation for me, with reason "just because",  which I replied I needed to (because they won't admit what they have done and said), multiple times before also appear, seemed that just to say the same thing and leave.

This together with all the things happened, are still happening and some that happened more recently give an increasing feeling that thing are not going to change for the better, and likely the opposite.

In fact, some things worse did happen or show recently. So bad that... maybe I should try to describe it a bit, when I write about it. To say it in a few words, the malice is insane. And there is the reverse causality (and many other things, from stupid to hideous) like you would expect from the Chinese Communist Party.

More on this later.
