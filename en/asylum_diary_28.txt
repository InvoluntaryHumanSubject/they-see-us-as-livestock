Confirmed today. Not a damn bit changed. Not a damn bit different.
The "subtlties" were not my overthinking.

Btw, some doors are locked. Must go out to the entrance on the other side to enter the hospital building to see the notices on the ground floor. A computer room that is said to open for 1 hour a day is also in the same area.
