The [noise/vibration](https://github.com/locharp/asylum_diary/tree/main/aac) changed. It doesn't make as loud a noise now, the tone also changed. It became even harder to record and harder to be differentiated from other sounds. I am not sure if the current noise is less harmful and if the following symptoms are caused by the previous one only, they definately start before the noise change, but I don't know if the current one is make them worse.

1. Tinnitus
There seems to be at least 2 different forms. A persistent subtler ring and an acute spike. There is no way I can tell for sure but it seems the spike comes randomly without need of stimulation.

2. Head pain
Head pain might not be a very accurate term, anyway it is some kind of discomfort around the head. Again I cannot tell for sure but the discomfort could be triggered by something inaudible.

3. Sleeping disorder
Not necessarily only mean not being able to sleep well at night directly due to the noise occurs at that time. This problem cause further problems.

There is also occasional arrhythmia which I guess is stimulated by something.

There were some instances of strange things in my food again. And then there was some burnt porridge yesterday, not sure what it meant but I certainly won't think they were the same thing. There had been worse compared to what I have found recently, but that's just what I was aware of. God knows how much I didn't notice.

I have been avoiding to mention things that directly damage my health. One of the reason is fearing that they would double down, and they will.

I probably have mentioned in some entries that I was given extra troubles, including by abusing power, after confronting the harassers. They have established the situation that I am seen as a lower being by pretty much everyone, and pretty much everyone harasses me when they like.

For example, people would intentionally walk into me, sometimes literally from the other side of the road. If I don't dodge? Oh, they actually would exaggeratedly dodge themselves. Much like, long ago, how they would insert themselves into the queue for food and then "you first, you first", "no problem bro" when arrived at the counter. It is absolutely absurd. But you will never know, along with being disgusted, I might get punished.

Basically if I confront an harasser, I get punished.
If I ignore them and they are not happy, I get punished.
Aw, if they are not happy, and what doesn't make them unhappy?

From the very beginning when I planned to give the best of me, they were not happy with it. When I still tried to maintain my spirit despite my worry never really stopped even having come aboard, apparently if I am not upset, they are not happy with it. When I stop trying to be optimistic, they are not happy with it. When I tried to be at least somewhat sociable, they were not happy with it. When I give up being sociable, they are not happy with it. When I look relaxed, not really, just because maybe I use my phone in a posture that looks relaxed, alone in my room no less, and they see it by surveillance, they are not happy with it. When I show a grim attitude that is appropriate to this situation, they are not happy with it. I don't know the English term for this, maybe psychological imbalance, or simply perverted, much like the perverts from my homeland.

If I have not mistaken, there were even times that they embarrassed themselves because of the human right violating surveillance they have always enjoyed a lot, and then think they should be the one who feel outraged.

There are people, with or without walking into me, like staring at me. A few days ago I stared back, and one of them stopped walking to keep staring at me. Apparently, they also do not think what they do is normal.

I used to partly agree that there is at least no life-theatening danger. I wasn't totally agree and I doubt even more now. The health problems I mentioned are not all, nor the most serious ones. It could be an unintended, heavy-handed "joke", this is not my wod, they literally uttered this after a year of insult along with damages to health. Or I could be killed off bit by bit. I am of course not a doctor, but there are already some damages that I am aware of could be permanent.

Without consequence they would gradually go further and further. With the lower-being impression they would easily convince themselves everything is my fault. Just like they blame me for "anti-society" after harassing and insulting me. They imply I should do this and that while controlling everything to toy with me. Perhaps they know very well that they are bullshitting and just don't have a problem with it.

Having people holding their phones so that the camera lens points to me is a routine thing, but there is a spike again recently. Yesterday there was even someone accompanied by officers used a dedicated camera.

There are also all kinds of stupid pettiness on-going. When pettiness pairs with power, it becomes a serious problem.

Was told to have an interview a few days later this morning.

"all the information you submit during the interview will be considered confidential", a note reads. Such mockery.

I asked to record the conversation they told me about the interview. They said it was forbidden and only let me record what they wanted to say at the end.

Far before noon the conversation was already known here and there.
