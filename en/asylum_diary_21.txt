I was told that there is WiFi in the building today, hours after posting the last entry. Like bed and food, it should be something to be thankful for. I hope that it doesn't come in a twisted way.

I have started to hate myself for having a peaceful nature and remaining open for hope that there could be misunderstanding. Similar to those who always think that the saint emperor just isn't aware of what truly is happening yet.

I have come to understand why some people hate people with this kind of nature. Because it is a nature that contributes to the success of authoritarianism.
