Three weeks.after the first secret court hearing on Zoom, direct access to the case on the court system is still not given to me. Moreover, they, including the court, are not even replying.
Wrote a formal request last week for other documents including my passport. Got a reply that the documents would be given me in 20 days. Asked for a concrete date but it was not given. There were many strange things.
