Was told that someone was coming to fix the ceiling by some social workers. Tried to make it easy for tne workers that were supposed to do the job. But what happened when I was away was something else. Nobody was in the room when I returned. Things in the room were moved. My things was moved away. Someone else clothes was put into the closet. Questioned what was happening. They only wanted to pretend the ceiling was the problem.

The social worker appeared to be ose to tears. With all the things that had happened, thought that the social worker is not the culprit and tried to tell the officer who spoke English to tell her the problem was not with her. Apparently I was being foolish again.

Maybe I will describe more details lager. All in all, they again do not admit there is any problem and terminate with talking about the ceiling.
