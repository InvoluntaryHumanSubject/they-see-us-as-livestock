This afternoon 2 officers came to my room and said someone complained about the noise I made while exercising in my room (punching against a mattress). Kind of searched my room in the process.*

Although I talked to them about it, saying that I have already limited it to short periods in the afternoon only, I have a bad feeling that it was meant for something else.

There were suggestions like doing it against the floor and doing it in the toilet.

There were also some strange questions like if I go to the kitchen (the hall for food) for food, which I replied I do.


I am getting accusations of some serious things during this period when they refuse to give me back my passport and let me leave, with requirements that very much exist because of them and are controlled by them. And with shut doors after saying what they want to say. With prohibition of recording by me, but recorded without telling me, which was even denied before, focused on my face, too.

So basically they are forcing this. Doing it in a way, I can't come up with a milder appropriate description, disregarding me being a human with human feelings. Even though I explicitly reminded them I am a human, like it is necessary, even though I told them I feel tortured, it still continues.

As always, there are more, including some strange things happening to my body. It increasingly worries me that I won't be able to leave safely.
