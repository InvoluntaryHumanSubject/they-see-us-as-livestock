This afternoon 2 officers came to my room said someone complained about the noise I made during exercising in my room (punching on mattress).

Although I talked to them about it, saying that I have already limited it to short peroids in the afternoon only, I have a bad feeling it was meant for something else.
There was also some strange questions like if I go to the kitchen (the hall for food) for food, which I replied I do.


During this period they refuse to give me back my passport and let me leave, I am getting accusations of some serious things. It increasingly worries me that I won't be able to leave safely.
