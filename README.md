The main diary entries are in the en/ (older) and the UK/ (more recent) folders.

It is not reader friendly as it was meant to be a record only.

I am a nobody, and this happens to me, it means it can happen to pretty much everyone.

I won't be surprised that I could be painted in many ways. You might think that I shouldn't act the way I do as an asylum seeker.

A simple fact is, I do but I didn't.

They might pretend they did only some unharmful stupid things.

Those are not the only things they did.

I confidently say that I tried to offer my best. More than just as an asylum seeker.

What I got was year long insult and torture that causes actual damages.

Even if consider only the asylum seeker part, I would have been thankful for the slightest or basic things such as a roof and simple food and I did. 

But they decided to side with the persecutors and join them in their persecution.

And then twist facts and reverse causes and results.

I don't hope that you (readers) can help me anymore. I hope only you will understand how things come to be and I hope that you can realize what gruesome things are happening in our world. How sick are those who look just the same as we are.

I don't know what we can do. But the first thing should be realising what ugly world we are living in.

My pessimistic believe is that it might already be too late and we might have little chance to change anything already.
