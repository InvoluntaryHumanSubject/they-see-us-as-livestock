The main diary entries are in the en/ (older) and the UK/ (more recent) folders.

It is not reader friendly as it was meant to be a record only. Maybe it is easier to read the newer entries first because they are more explicit.

I am a nobody, and this happens to me, it means it can happen to pretty much everyone.

I won't be surprised that I could be painted in many ways. You might think that I shouldn't act the way I do as an asylum seeker.

A simple fact is, I do but I didn't.

I'll specify one thing here. I tried to learn Lithuanian on my own soon after I arrived there, when there was no class. What happen THEN was that they started to pretend finally providing class. I will be fair that a small portion of the later classes was quite real. But most of the time little of exactly what I had learned by myself which they clearly knew by the dehumanising surveillance was taught in an intentional unhelpful way. It couldn't be coincidence. And that came with harassment or worse that I feared what they were truely doing. I have written the same in the entries, perhaps less explicitly back then.

They might pretend they do only some unharmful stupid things.

Those are not the only things they do.

I confidently say that I tried to offer my best. More than just as an asylum seeker. 

What I got was year long insult and torture that causes actual damages.

Even if consider only the asylum seeker part, I would have been thankful for the slightest or basic things such as a roof and simple food and I did. 

But they decided to side with the persecutors and join them in their persecution.

And then twist facts and reverse causes and results.

I don't hope that you (readers) can help me anymore. I hope only you will understand how things come to be and I hope that you can realize what gruesome things are happening in our world. How sick are those who look just the same as we are.

I don't know what we can do. But the first thing should be realising what ugly world we are living in.

My pessimistic believe is that it might already be too late and we might have little chance to change anything already.
