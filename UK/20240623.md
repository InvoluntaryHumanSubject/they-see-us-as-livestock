Receive a few papers from the Holiday Inn staff around the middle of May. It stated that I would be evicted whether or not I move to Bibby Stockholm at the end of May. Confirm with the staff that was the case before leaving. Slightly before that got a copy of agreement I had never seen with my electronic signature printed on it.

Contacted the home office email address stated on the papers to request accommodation with self-catering and openable window. Was rejected stating no supporting evidence. I replied that they know what happened as they are together. Receieved another rejection after moved.

The air and god know what problem that caused my respiratory problem had been continuing, changing in severity.

Same thing happened again at Bibby Stockholm along with some other things wrong on the day of arrvival. I won't list all of them here.

I was asked to sign a paper for using the gym, provide email and mobile number, and provide an electronic signature which I was led to believe that it was meant to be a sample for them. Later was told that I signed an agreement I had never seen. On the agreement is a statement supposed from me stating that I believe I have no disease. Told them about the respiratary problem and it could be a disease. Wanted to correct the problem without escalation. Wanted to get the contact of the site manager as the agreement stated it should be provided, but they refused. They argued what that statement mean and provided an email address started with reception1. Received the agreement by email when it was around two weeks after the day of arrival from an email address that started with reception2. Sent a reply to both email addresses and stated the problems. Didn't get a response.

Tried to use the ASPEN card I received before moving to Bibby Stockholm but failed. Contacted Migrant Help and some new issues raised, including address on enquiry entry changed to Holiday Inn and entries disappearing.

Sent another request for self-catered accommodation in which I called them out 
for working together with the persecutors. And stated although there are worse tortures in the world, what they do to me still amonut to torture.

It was ridiculous, I mean the fact that I am contacting them, the persecutors.

But so were the past years.

Coughed non-stop the same evening and felt ill the next morning. I mean it was more severe. I have been suffering these problems
all along which are obviously intended. So amazing for being a human among humans.

Talked about what I experienced in a game. Unwise I guess. Pretty sure the persecutors are there.

Other pathetic things are of course not stopped.
