Went out for 2 hours. Things happened in the room both before and after I returned. Also, the room is dirtier than this morning*.

More things happen to and during meals.

Wondered if it was after effects, but it seems more likely that they are reusing more torture methods used in Lithuania and Hong Kong.

I keep realising more and more how I was exploited and suffered crimes for longer than I knew. But there are probably still more.

From time to time I wonder if they ever... Anyway, they are.
