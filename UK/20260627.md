Unless it's coincidence, I was subjected to yet another effect that also happened many times and an another strange one which I am not sure if it was a side effect or what.

I am afraid more and more permanent damage will be accumulated.

All they need to justify anything are some magic words to mumble. And it worked for them for years? How is this even possible? In 21th century no less?
