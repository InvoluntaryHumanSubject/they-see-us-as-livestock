Days ago someone showed some aggression towards me in the IT suite. Wanting to keep a record I asked for a copy of the footage. They denied, saying that they deemed there was no assault. I said I had never said there was and I had actually said clearly that there was no direct contact, but I still wanted to keep a record. They gave me an email address and told me to contact the port police and Migrant Help instead.

I am still trying to get replies from the email address they specified more than a month ago when they refused to give the 24 hour contact details of the site manager as stated on a document they showed me. They have sent emails to me with a similar email address, but I received no reply from either of them.

Tried the port police and the Dorset police. 

The port police said that they couldn't give me the footage, just suggested that they could talk to the staff on board.

The Dorset police station was closed. I am already no stranger to closed properties since the persecution, but I realised something else just now.

There are some things extra strange around this matter.
