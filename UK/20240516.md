Since before I left Lithuania they became blatant and frequent in framing me for the troubles they cause, of which I am the victim no less. It continued in Latvia and continues here in the UK. It has become a norm to them.

And don't forget what these people are supposed to be.

Oh, but what can I really do? All these years, not only in the first place I fled, but in all the countries I have gone to or passed, every person who joined the persecution did so without a question. Not a single person who joined acted in a way I would consider a reasonable human would. Not kidding. Not a single one. As in one minus one. Zero.

And don't forget the degree of harm (crime) they are causing.

But even I don't really know how many crimes they are commiting.
