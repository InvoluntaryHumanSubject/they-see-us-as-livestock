There was a smell in the room when I moved in. It was disappearing over time but recently returned.

Went to places including another police station - the Dorset Police Headquarter. The one behind the reception failed to produce her identification when she asked for and was looking at mine. Wasn't even surprised.

Two in uniform came in a vehicle with police livery to stop me after I left. The location has very scarce passers-by, but it happened some passed by soon, with phone camera pointing our way. One even came to talk to the officers, with phone camera pointed our way.

Continue to suffer subtle health damage and harassment everyday.

I believe real humans having reading and understanding the situation will understand the further problems will be even more horrible.
