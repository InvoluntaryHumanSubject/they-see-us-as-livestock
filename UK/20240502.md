about 1 week ago: something resemblanced a fire drill.
days ago: went and tried to contact and ask for a secure method for contacting with Home Office. There was something resemblanced a protest there.



2 full years since applied for asylum in Lithuania.

My health continues to sustain damages.

There will probably be some serious problems even for the best future scenario. But nothing good can come out of talking about it.
