For unknown reason my phone produces a lot of noises in the recordings. The strange noise of interest is relatively faint and hard to record. Watch out for the spikes of noises if you need to turn up the volume to hear it.

You can find the strange noise intermittent in most recordings as they are not ambient but occur at and affect small areas.
