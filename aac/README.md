For unknown reason my phone produces a lot of noises in the recordings. The strange noise of interest is relatively faint and hard to record. Watch out for the spikes of noises if you need to turn up the volume to hear it.

You can find the strange noise intermittent in most recordings as they are not ambient but occur at and affect small areas.

Here is a clearer sample you can listen online on [Whyp](https://www.whyp.it/tracks/105086/8-jun-0343ucca-strange-noise?token=cTa8Q).

What I have confirmed are:
1. It is not ambient
2. It often has an area of effect with a radius less than 1 meter
3. It is distinct from some other normal vibration sources
4. The centres of occurrence can be ordinary things, sometimes right at my head
5. There can have multiple occurrences at the same time
6. Since the area of effect is small, the occurrences I noticed were around/at my head
7. Sometimes a centre of occurrence seems to be able to move
8. It is faint most of the times, tend to be louder at night with the quietness of night considered

It has been a few months since the first time I noticed it around my head when I was sleeping. (Written on 19 Ja , 2023)
